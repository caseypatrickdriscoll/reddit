# Lightnet~b

This is a fork of the Reddit open source codeline that will be used to power Lightnet~b, which we will be
using as the basis for building a social movement around economics based on abundance and sharing as well
as the integration of social structures and economics with modern social technology.

### Quickstart

The easiest way to get started developing is to use the [Developer Tools](https://github.com/new-day-international/development)
we have checked into our development github project. 


### Reddit

The fork comes from the primary codebase that powers [reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com).

The github project for Reddit is at [https://github.com/reddit/reddit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit).

### Notes to ponder

 * If you are making changes to a consumer upstart job, you will need to restart it to see the code changes.  You have been lulled to sleep by the beauty of the webserver's automatic reloading.
